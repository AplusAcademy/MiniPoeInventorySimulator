## Mini Path of Exile Inventory Simulator
A mini game I made for school. It needed PHP CodeIgniter to run, and wasn't very shareable.  
Now it's just html and javascript, no backend necessary.

Double click index.html to open.
Click the inventory tabs on the right, then drag-n-drop pieces of equipment into their respective slots on the left.
